# Iexfib

Short little Elixir App that calculates Fibonacci numbers, either as a sequence or a certain number you ask for.

## Installation

Of course you need Elixir and Erlang running on your system.

Clone the repo, cd in it and fire up `iex -S mix`

Calculate the first 100 Fibonacci numbers with

`Iexfib.fib(100, true)`

or grab just the 55th Fibonacci number with

`Iexfib.grab_fib(55, true)`
